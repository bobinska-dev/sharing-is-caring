### Customise your desk structure with Icons and more â€“Â While keeping the code clean! (Sanity v2)

:fire: Template for singleton in pages folder :fire:

When customising your desk structure, it can be hard to keep track of all parts. This is why I split the code up in and packed it into singletons (here pages) and `documentType` structures, which are then imported into a `deskStructure/index.js`. This way your code stays readable and managable by people, especially if they have ADHD like me :wink:. `Structure Builder` can be a bit unruly, so here you go .... [See Snippets](https://github.com/bobinska-dev/sharing-is-caring/tree/main/Structure%20Builder%20with%20icons/deskStructure)
